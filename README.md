# SVM-Frank-Wolfe
This project explores and compares three optimization algorithms for Support Vector Machines (SVM): the original Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm, the Away-Step Frank-Wolfe (AFW), and the Pairwise Frank-Wolfe (PFW). These methods address convex optimization problems with constraints, making them particularly suitable for machine learning tasks. The study evaluates their performance on binary classification datasets: heart failure prediction, breast cancer diagnosis, and customer churn analysis. The algorithms are assessed regarding classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and convergence properties. Our findings demonstrate that AFW and PFW outperform FW in handling boundary solutions, albeit at the cost of increased computational time.
