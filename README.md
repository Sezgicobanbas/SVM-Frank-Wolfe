# SVM-Frank-Wolfe
This project compares SVM optimization algorithms: Frank-Wolfe (FW), Away-Step FW (AFW), and Pairwise FW (PFW). It evaluates accuracy, efficiency, and convergence on tasks like heart failure prediction and breast cancer diagnosis. AFW and PFW handle boundaries better but require more computation.
